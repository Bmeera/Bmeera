## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a strong background in Computer Science and a deep interest in sustainability and real-world impact. I enjoy building meaningful products — from mobile to web apps — and I'm always excited to learn, grow, and collaborate on projects that matter.

I'm currently a Graduate Teaching Assistant, co-founder of Recyklable (a climate-focused nonprofit), and on a mission to use tech for good.
